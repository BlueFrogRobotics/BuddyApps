    <summary>Here is the story without a top of a caramelized apple pie of legend, which is cooked upside down but is eaten at the place. Originally from Sologne in the 19th century, Tarte Tatin owes its name to two sisters: Caroline and Stéphanie Tatin. According to the versions, the legend says that the recipe would be the result of an awkwardness (the pie would have been reversed and then cooked upside down), an oversight (the apples would have cooked too long) or would simply be the reproduction of A former Solognote specialty. However, the victim of its success, it exported to Paris in 1926. Served for the first time in the restaurant Maxim's, it has since become a classic French tables!</summary>
